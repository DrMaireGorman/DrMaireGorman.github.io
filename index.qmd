I was part of University-wide working group looking at embedding wellbeing in the curriculum as part of the Aberystwyth University APEX strategy. 


## Curriculum Review and development
*	Year 1 core physics director (40 credits): I am overseeing the work of multiple lecturers, demonstrators and workshop leads in rolling out this new module which has been designed to align to new IOP accreditation. 

*	MSc Nuclear Science and Engineering MSc steering group committee member: I have introduced research & study skills sessions and personal tutoring framework to this scheme and am involved in re-accreditation application (spring 2024). 

* Curriculum Review Group Member (September 2022 – present) 

* Contributed to Aberystwyth astrophysics education review – suggestions for structural changes across astrophysics and planetary science modules were implemented.

* Introduced machine learning into physics curriculum at Aberystwyth University. 

*	Working group member, design of new PGT MSc programme in Radio Spectrum Engineering (2020)

I am a member of the ExoMol research group (based at UCL) which is the world-leader in providing the necessary computed molecular data needed for the exoplanet community to detect molecules in exoplanet atmospheres. 

I work with international collaborators and, in additional to the lead-author journal article listed below, I have acted as co-author for 7 published refereed journal articles. I have presented talks at national level (2017, 2018, 2022) and international level (2014) and posters at national level for an additional 8 other distinct projects. 
I am currently writing an invited book chapter (30 pages, 15k words, Elsevier) for “Handbook of Astrochemistry” on Theoretical Molecular Spectroscopy (publication due 2025). 

I organised a lunchtime session at NAM (July 2019) on “Exoplanet magnetism” which brought together experts in this emerging discipline and was sponsored by Europlanet
